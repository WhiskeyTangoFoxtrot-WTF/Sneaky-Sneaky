# Sneaky-Sneaky
Sneaky-Sneaky is an encryption system that demonstrates various encryption methods, including Normal, AES, ECC, and RSA. While the code itself is quite basic and has not been updated for a long time, it serves as a starting point for understanding how encryption works. Please note that this is not intended for real-world security use.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your needs. If you're planning to create a video or post about this, we'd appreciate it if you gave credit to this group.
